## Hi Everyone,
We will be using Prettier to keep our code styling the same. Prettier is a linter on VS Code. You can download it by searching for it in the extensions window of VS Code. This is where we downloaded Live Server, Live Sass Compiler etc.

I will ask Gary how to config Prettier tomorow

Also, 
Insure that when you setup your site on Netlify, that you specify the build command to be:

npm run build
